          I am currently enrolled in the MS in Information Systems program, maintaining a perfect CGPA 4/4. I completed my undergraduate studies in Information Technology. Following that, I gained valuable experience at Accenture, where I actively contributed to various analytics, data, and software projects. Notably, in the Electricity De France (EDF) team, 
          we achieved a significant milestone by reducing energy consumption by 30%. I have also interned in SBI India's largest bank.
